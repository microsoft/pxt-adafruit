# Assignment Operator

Use an equals sign to make a [variable](/blocks/variables/var) store the [number](/reference/types/number) 
or [string](/reference/types/string) you say.

When you use the equals sign to store something in a variable, the equals sign is called
an *assignment operator*, and what you store is called a *value*.

### Storing numbers in variables

This program makes the variable `item` equal `5` and then shows it on the [LED screen](/device/screen).

````blocks
let item = 5
basic.showNumber(item)
````

### Storing strings in variables

This program makes the variable `name` equal `Joe` and then shows it on the [LED screen](/device/screen).

````blocks
let name = "Joe"
basic.showString(name);
````

### Notes

You can use the assignment operator with variables of 
every [type](/reference/types). A *type* is which kind of thing
a variable can store, like a number or string.
