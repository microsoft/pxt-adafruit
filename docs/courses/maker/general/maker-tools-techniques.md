# Maker Tools and Techniques 

Here is a look at the tools and some of the techniques that will be useful in completing the projects in this book. The maker experience and mindset are about experimentation, iteration, and trial and error, so be sure to give yourself and your students room to explore, fail, and find work-arounds. Having some basic tools and techniques on hand will let you dive into that process.

Electronic Components: Adafruit and other electronics suppliers carry items handy for projects like battery packs, conductive thread, servo motors, NeoPixels, and more. Here is Adafruit’s curated list of products that are compatible with the Circuit Playground Express: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/accessories, and some examples of electronic components you may need:

A variety of battery packs with [JST connectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JST_connector) work well.

**Hot Glue Guns**: These come in mini and standard sizes. The minis are easier to store and are better for smaller hands. They do require more frequent insertion of new glue sticks though. Be sure to order the correct size glue sticks for the glue gun you choose. Burns from the nozzle tips or the glue itself will happen, but they are rarely serious and serve as a reminder to be more careful in the future. Look for glue guns that come with protective plastic nozzle covers that help prevent burns. For example – https://www.amazon.com/Glue-Gun-TopElek-Temperature-Projects/dp/B0776MFZ2W

**Cardboard shears, craft knife, box cutter, or saw**: Normal scissors are not designed to cut cardboard and will often start to loosen at the hinge if used repetitively to cut cardboard. Shears, a saw, or a knife are a better bet. Deciding whether to let students use knives will depend on their age and temperament. It’s a good idea to emphasize that the hand that isn’t holding the knife should never be in the path of the blade. Teachers can also have a couple of cutting stations near each other where supervision is centralized. Another idea is to have students qualify to be able to use knives by passing a skills and safety test.

Some examples:

* Safe Cardboard Cutter – https://www.amazon.com/Klever-Kutter-Cutters-Red-Pack/dp/B071DHSXWF
* Craft Pen Knife – https://www.amazon.com/X-ACTO-2-Knife-Safety-Cap/dp/B000V1QV7O
* Cardboard Scissors – https://www.amazon.com/ALLEX-Cardboard-Scissors-15102-Paperwork/dp/B07DZ4W2H3

**Masking tape, duct tape, or clear packing tape**: It’s very handy to have different types of tape on hand. You should not apply hot glue to the Circuit Playground Express, but a loop of tape on the back is often all you need to secure the device. Masking tape is also great for wrapping around servo motors because you can then hot glue them and have an easier time getting them free of the glue.

Some of my favorites include:

* Colored Masking Tape – https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NANPNZC
* Patterned Duct Tape – https://www.amazon.com/Duck-Random-Colored-Decorative-Designs/dp/B0792BQDRD
* Clear Packing Tape – https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J07BRQ
* Electrical Tape – https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B19FDK
