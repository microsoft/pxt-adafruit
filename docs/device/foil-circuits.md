# foil circuits

The large holes at the bottom of the board are designed to attach alligator/crocodile clips 
to create electrical circuit with other components.

If you do not have crocodile clips at hand, dyou can use wires or even Aluminium foil to acheive the same result.
We will show you how to connect the micro:bit to headphones using Alumunium foil and tape.

### Materials

* micro:bit and battery pack (you can also power it via USB)
* a small piece of cardboard
* Aluminium foil
* tape

### Assembly instructions

Tape the micro:bit and battery pack to the card board. Make sure to remove the batteries while you are building your circuit.

Cut the thinest strip of foil possible and roll it into a cable. You can also try to fold, whatever works for you.
Build two of those wires.

Place the foil wire on the ``GND`` pin and attach with a piece of tape. Press hard to get the best connection between
the foil and the pin board. Make sure the foil is not overlapping with the other pins!

Place the second wire on the ``P0`` pin the same way. Make sure the wire does not overlap with the other pins!

Tape the headphone jack connector to the cardboard and roll the wire coming from ``GND`` around the metal base. 
Make sure the wire does not touch the other metal rings on the jack.
