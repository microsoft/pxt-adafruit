# Capacitive touch

An analog input pin can read a voltage level that ranges from the supply voltage of your board 3.3 v (**3.3V**) down to 0 v (**GND**). The value returned to your program from reading the pin is not the actual voltage value but a binary digital number that represents the input signal level.

## Experiments

There are several experiments to let you test out the concepts you learn in the analog input sections. You'll need a few things to in order to perform some of the experiments.
