# beautiful image blocks challenges

Coding challenges for the beautiful image tutorial. 

## Before we get started

Complete the [beautiful image](/lessons/beautiful-image/activity) activity and your code will look like this:

```blocks
basic.showLeds(`
    # # # # #
    # # . # #
    # . # . #
    # # . # #
    # # # # #
    `)
```

### Challenge 1

Now show an new image that will display on the @boardname@.

```blocks
basic.showLeds(`
    # # # # #
    # # . # #
    # . # . #
    # # . # #
    # # # # #
    `)
basic.showLeds(`
    # . # . #
    . # # # .
    . . # . .
    . # # # .
    # . # . #
    `)
```

* Does your code work as expected?

### Challenge 2

Nice job! Why don't we create a third image that will show after the other two?
