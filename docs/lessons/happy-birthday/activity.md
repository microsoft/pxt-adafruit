# happy birthday blocks activity

Play sounds with music blocks.

Have you ever tried to play a song on an instrument? Let's try coding the song "Happy Birthday" on the @boardname@ !

Let's start by adding the code in the music drawer that includes a single musical chord (or pitched sound) with the `play` block. Then insert the chord "C". Once you are done coding, don't forget to run your code in the simulator or the @boardname@.

```blocks
music.playTone(music.noteFrequency(Note.C), music.beat(BeatFraction.Quarter));
```

* click run to see if the code works as expected.

We want to continue to adding musical chords with the `play` block. So insert the appropriate chord blocks: `D`, `F`, `G` to complete the first part of the song. Modify your code so that your code looks like this.

```blocks
music.playTone(music.noteFrequency(Note.C), music.beat(BeatFraction.Quarter));
music.playTone(music.noteFrequency(Note.C), music.beat(BeatFraction.Quarter));
music.playTone(music.noteFrequency(Note.D), music.beat(BeatFraction.Quarter));
music.playTone(music.noteFrequency(Note.C), music.beat(BeatFraction.Quarter));
music.playTone(music.noteFrequency(Note.F), music.beat(BeatFraction.Quarter));
music.playTone(music.noteFrequency(Note.E), music.beat(BeatFraction.Quarter));
basic.pause(100);
```
