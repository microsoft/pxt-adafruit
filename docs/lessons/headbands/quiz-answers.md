let coll: string[] = []
basic.showString(coll[0], 150)
```

## 3. Consider the following lines of code.

```blocks
let coll: string[] = []

coll.push("clock")
coll.push("cat")
```

Write the line of code that will display the string "cat" using `data->coll`.

<br/>

```blocks
let coll: string[] = []
basic.showString(coll[2], 150)
```

## 4. Consider the following line of code.

```blocks
let coll: string[] = []
```

Write the five (5) lines of code that will add the following five words to `data->coll`: puppy, clock, night, cat, cow.

<br/>

```blocks
let coll: string[] = []
coll.push("puppy")

coll.push("night")
coll.push("cat")
coll.push("cow")
```
