# looper blocks activity

Welcome! This activity will teach how to display a series of numbers for a for loop. Let's get started!

Let's create a for loop where `0` is the loop's starting value, `i` is the index variable, and `5` is the ending value. The index variable `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each time through the loop. The loop ends when `i = 5`.


```blocks
for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    
}
```

We will show the number of times the loop has been executed. It will go from zero to five times.

```blocks
for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    basic.showNumber(i)
}
```

The for loop while cycle through to six immediately unless we pause for a little bit in between each loop.

```blocks
for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    basic.showNumber(i)
    basic.pause(2000)
}
```
