# lucky 7 blocks challenges

Coding challenges for lucky 7.

## Before we get started

Complete the [lucky 7 activity](/lessons/lucky-7/activity) and your code will look like this:

```blocks
basic.showNumber(7)
```

### Challenge 1

But we also should pause before showing another number. Let's add a pause of 500 milliseconds.

```blocks
basic.showNumber(7)
basic.pause(500)
```

### Challenge 2

What about other multiples of 7? Let's display the next multiple of 7 on the screen!

```blocks
basic.showNumber(7)
basic.pause(500)
basic.showNumber(14)
```

* Run the code to see if it works as expected.

### Challenge 3

Keep displaying multiples of 7 such as 21 and 28...
