# magic logo activity

Show an image that points up when the logo is up.

Welcome! This tutorial will help you display an arrow pointing toward the logo! Let's get started.

Using the **accelerometer** sensor, the @boardname@ can detect when the **logo** is oriented **up**. We call that the **logo up** event. We will use `on logo up` to register an event handler that will run when the **logo up** event happens.

```blocks
input.onGesture(Gesture.LogoUp, () => {
    
})
```

When the @boardname@ goes logo up, the code nested under the `on logo up` function will run. Let's add a line of code to show LEDs in there.

```blocks
input.onGesture(Gesture.LogoUp, () => {
    basic.showLeds(`
        . . # . .
        . # # # .
        # # # # #
        . . # . .
        . . # . .
        `)
})
```

Run your code and try to turn around the @boardname@ to see the **logo up** event in action!
