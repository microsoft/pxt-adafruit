Learn how to use running time. We will be learning how to create a pogo game using variables, forever loop, conditionals, on button pressed, as well as simple commands, such as show LEDs and clear screen.

## Documentation
```cards
let jumps = 0
let acc = input.acceleration(Dimension.Y)
basic.showNumber(0)
led.stopAnimation()

    `)
basic.clearScreen()
if (true) {}
radio.onDataPacketReceived(() => { })
```
