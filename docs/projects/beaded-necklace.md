Materials:

* 1 Adafruit Circuit Playground Express (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333)
* 1 micro USB cable (not pictured, i.e. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019C0BB9C)
* 1 small lipo battery (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1578) – note, these are rechargeable, so you may also want to invest in a charger for your battery too (https://www.adafruit.com/product/259)
* 4 Flora NeoPixels (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1260)
* Thin copper wire (I used 26 gauge https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IJYRKW)
* Wire cutters (i.e. https://www.amazon.com/Hakko-CHP-170-Micro-Cutter/dp/B00FZPDG1K)
* Tweezers or needle nose pliers (i.e. https://www.amazon.com/SE-LF01-Professional-Quality-Needle/dp/B001BQF1AQ) 
* 3 strands (40 beads each) of beads – I used 6mm glass beads 
* Ribbon – to tie the ends of the necklace 
* Double-sided tape – to tape on the battery pack

Note – I also use a piece of fabric on top of my working surface so my beads don’t roll around too much
