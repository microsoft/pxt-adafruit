## Duration ~ 30 minutes 

**Important**
make sure the [Code](/projects/cloud/code) portion of this project is done before making the cloud!

## Step 1: Setting Up the Lantern

Open your paper lantern and expand it. Tape your Adafruit on the bottom of the inside of your lantern. Tape your Neopixels to the side of the inside of your lantern in a circular pattern.

 Next, cut a small hole on the bottom of the lantern near the adafruit and put the wire of the battery pack through the paper. Connect it to your Adafruit and let the battery pack hang outside of the lantern.

## Step 2: Making the Cloud

Start hot gluing your polyester filling or cotton onto the lantern piece by piece. Get creative with your cloud!

## Step 3: Finishing Touches

Cut out a piece of string to whatever length you want. Tie both ends to your lantern so you can hang your cloud!

Lastly, draw 2 lightning bolts and color them yellow. Cut them out and tape them onto both sides of the battery pack to hide it.
