Let's make a confetti drop box for your @boardname@!

### Duration: ~1 hour and 10 minutes 

## ``|Step 1|`` - Cut the cardboard and glue the frame
To make the sides of the box frame, cut **four** 6 inch by 6 inch pieces of cardboard.

Using the glue gun, stick these pieces together to form a box shape.

## ``|Step 2|`` - Add the box base

Cut out a rectangular piece of cardboard measuring 6 inches by 6.5 inches.
Then, cut out a 3.5 inch by 3.5 inch square in the center of your base piece. This allows the confetti to fall through onto your friends! Make sure to keep the small 3.5 by 3.5 piece you just cut out... We'll be using that later.

Now, glue the base to your box frame.

## ``|Step 3|`` - Make an angle bracket

Cut **three** 1 inch by 1.5 inch pieces of cardboard. Stack and glue them together. Do the same thing again but with **three** 1 inch by 2 inch pieces of cardboard. Finally, bring the two stacks of cardboard together at a right angle and glue them together. This forms an angle bracket to mount your servo.

## ``|Step 4|`` - Mount the servo

Take the the servo and twist it counterclockwise until there is resistance and you're unable to turn it any further. This will make sure that the servo is in the 180Â° position and will give the servo enough distance to turn when we want to rotate our cardboard piece clockwise.

Glue the 3.5 inch by 3.5 inch square leftover piece onto the servo. Stick it to the servo so that it will mostly cover the bottom of the box but will be able to spin so it can open the hole at the bottom of the box.

**The servo turns to open the drop hole**

Glue one end of your cardboard bracket to the edge of the box and the other end to the servo.

**Attach the servo to the bracket**

Make sure its position allows the cardboard to cover the hole and, as the servo rotates, to expose the hole (and drop lots of confetti on your unsuspecting friend!).

## ``|Step 5|`` - Create a funnel

Cut out **two** 6 inch by 6 inch pieces of cardboard and **two** 6 inch by 2.75 inch pieces of cardboard. Place them inside the box so they create a funnel leading to the bottom hole. This helps the confetti fall smoothly out of the box.

Ok, now glue them into place.

## ``|Step 6|`` - Add suction cups

Glue the two suction cups to the side of the box. These let you mount your box on windows, doors, etc.

**Stick on the suction cups**

## ``|Step 7|`` - Add circuit playground and battery pack

It's time to connect the box to our @boardname@:

1. Attach one end of a **red** crocodile clip to the **3.3V** pin on the @boardname@. Connect the other end to the **power** wire on the servo (usually a red wire).
2. Attach one end of a **black** crocodile clip to the **GND** pin on the @boardname@. Connect the other end to the **ground** wire on the servo (usually a black wire).
3. Attach one end of a **yellow** crocodile clip to the **A1** pin on the @boardname@. Connect the other end to the **signal** wire on the servo (usually the yellow wire).

**Connect the crocodile clips**

Secure the circuit playground to the side of the box using a piece of tape. Attach the battery pack nearby and connect the battery pack to the @boardname@.

## ``|Step 8|`` - Decorate!

Use stickers, markers, tissue paper, or anything else you have, to decorate the box. This gives your box a bit of a personal touch.

## Complete!
