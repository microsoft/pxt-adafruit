### ~hint

   * Make sure the @boardname@ is placed is such a way that the battery connector is at the top, and the USB connector is at the bottom. This will be necessary when connecting the battery pack.

## Step 4: Add a battery pack

At the back of the dandelion, use a cut of tape to stick the battery pack to the dandelion.
Place it around the middle of the stick, so there's enough room for the cable to reach the @boardname@.
