### ~hint
**Important**

Make sure the @boardname@ is placed so that the battery connector is at the top, and the USB connector is at the bottom. This is necessary to connect the battery pack later.

## Step 4: Add a battery pack

Cut a piece of tape to attach the battery pack to the back of the dandelion.
Place it around the middle of the stick so there's enough room for the cable to reach the @boardname@.
