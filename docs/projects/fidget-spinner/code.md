Light up your fidget spinner

### ~

## Duration: ~45 minutes

Using fast NeoPixels animations, 
it is possible to create a [stroboscopic effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroboscopic_effect) 
with the fidget spinner!

## Built-in animations

Try to create programs that use the built-in animations and spin them on the fidget.

```blocks
loops.forever(() => {
    light.pixels.showAnimation(light.animation(LightAnimation.Rainbow), 500)
})
```

* Does it look as expected?
* Did you try `sparkle` or `theater chase`? 

## Fun with Photon

Use the light photon to create small animation and test them out while strobing. 
Are you able to create cool effects?

```blocks
light.pixels.setPhotonMode(PhotonMode.PenUp)
loops.forever(() => {
    light.pixels.photonForward(1)
})
```

* Pick your favorite photon program and try it out?

## Coarser control

At the core, photon is just turning on and off LEDs on the board. Let's get down to that point.

We start by defining a subset of the pixels (0 through 4) so that only 1 column of pixels is turned on.

```blocks
let left = light.pixels.range(0, 5)
```

Then we add a [while loop](/blocks/loops/while) to repeat the animation step.
A single step clears all the LEDs, turns on 1 location and increment the position counter.

```blocks
let left = light.pixels.range(0, 5)
let c = 0
while (true) {
    left.clear()
    left.setPixelColor(c, Colors.Red)
    left.show()
    c = (c + 1) % left.length()
    loops.pause(5)
}
```
