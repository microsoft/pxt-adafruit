# Making the Guitar

### @description Making part of the @boardname@ air guitar project

## Step 1: Design the guitar body

the shape of your guitar.
* Trace the design on a flat piece of cardboard (40-80 cm is best).

**Helpful ideas**

* Use a straight-edge or ruler for lines
* Avoid small details that are difficult to cut into cardboard

## Step 2: Cut out the body

* Use box cutters to cut away big areas of cardboard, and use scissors to cut out the detailed parts

You can use another piece of cardboard on the back to reinforce the creases in the cardboard and other thin parts like the neck.
