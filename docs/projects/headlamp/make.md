## Step 1: Prepare the rubber band

We will use a rubber band to allow the headband to stretch a little.

Take a small piece of tape (2-3 inches long), and cut it in two along its length, so that you end up with two narrow pieces.

Fold one of the pieces on itself around the rubber band.

Do the same thing with the second piece of tape, at the opposite side of the rubber band.

## Step 2: Complete the headband

Cut a long piece of tape. This will go around your head, so make sure it's long enough - the circomference of your head is longer than you think!
To give you an idea, the piece of tape in the picture below is a little too short, but it will do for demonstration purposes.

Turn the piece of tape around so that the sticky side is facing you.
Take the rubber band and stick one of the folded pieces of tape to the edge of the long piece of tape.

Fold the long piece of tape onto itself along its length to make a long, thin headband.
Do not fold all the way just yet - stop about halfway to leave the other edge open.

To complete the headband, stick the rubber band's folded piece of tape that is still free to the other edge of the headband.
This is a little tricky to do, but don't give up!

Once that is done, fold the rest of the headband onto itself.

## Step 3: Attach the @boardname@ and the battery holder

Take a small piece of tape, and fold it on itself on the non-sticky side, so that it's sticky all around.

Stick the small piece of tape on the bottom face of your @boardname@.

![Lamp 3.2](/static/cp/projects/headlamp/step3.2.jpg)

Next, stick your @boardname@ to the front of the headband, at the opposite of the rubber band.

![Lamp 3.3](/static/cp/projects/headlamp/step3.3.jpg)

Finally, hook the battery pack on one side of the headband.
