  * Markers and/or paint
  * Scissors

## Step 1: Making a circle

Draw a circle on a piece of cardboard about 8 in (20 cm) across. Carefully cut the circle out using a pair of scissors.

## Step 2: Adding color

Trace the circle onto a piece of construction paper using a pencil or pen. Carefuly cut out this circle and glue it on top of the cardboard.

## Step 3: Cutting out the triangles

Using a different color of construction paper, cut out five triangles to serve as the spokes of our Lucky Wheel.
Each triangle should be a little bit longer than half the width of the wheel.

## Step 4: Gluing the triangles

Glue the triangles down one by one. For each triangle, place the @boardname@ down as a guide to make sure that it lines up up with one light on the board.

Next, cut off the excess paper from the bases of the triangles so they are even with edge of the wheel.

## Step 5: Numbers

Mark a number for each light using a marker, paint, or glitter glue.

## Step 6: Finishing Touches

Tape the @boardname@ down on the center of the wheel by rolling the tape into a cylinder (sticky side out) on the back of the board.

Clip the battery pack onto the back of the wheel for power.
