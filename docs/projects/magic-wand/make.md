## Step 4: Attach your board

Use a small piece of tape and roll it inside out so that the sticky side is on the outside.

Place the tape at the top of the wooden stick and use it to stick the @boardname@ onto your magic wand.

### ~hint
**Important**

Make sure the @boardname@ is placed so that the battery connector is at the top, and the USB connector is at the bottom. This is necessary to connect the battery pack later.

## Step 5: Add a battery pack

Connect the battery pack to the @boardname@.

Cut a piece of tape to attach the battery pack to the back of the magic wand.
Place it around the middle of the stick so there's enough room for the cable to reach the @boardname@.
