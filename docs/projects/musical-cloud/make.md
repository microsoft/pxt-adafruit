**Important**: make sure the [Code](/projects/musical-cloud/code) portion of this project is done before making the cloud! Otherwise, it will be hard to download your code once the cloud make is done.

## Duration ~ 30 minutes 

## Step 1: Setting Up the Lantern

Open your paper lantern from the package and expand it. Tape your @boardname@ at the bottom of the inside of your lantern. Tape your NeoPixels strip to the side of the inside of your lantern in a circular pattern.

Next, cut a small hole on the bottom of the lantern near the board and put the wire for the battery pack through the paper. Connect it to your @boardname@ and let the battery pack hang down outside of the lantern.

## Step 2: Making the Cloud

Now, hot glue your polyester filling or cotton onto the lantern piece by piece. Get creative and make your cloud have an interesting shape!

## Step 3: Finishing Touches

Cut a piece of string to let the cloud hang down to a length you like. Tie both ends to the lantern so you can hang your cloud!

Finally, draw 2 lightning bolts and color them yellow. Cut out the lighting bolts and tape each one on either side of the battery pack. This helps to hide the battery pack.
