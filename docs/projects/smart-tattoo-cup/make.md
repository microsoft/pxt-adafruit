## Step 1: Cut the coffee cup

Cut a rectangular opening in the side of the coffee cup.

## Step 2: Design the Smart Tattoos and Pencil-in on Cup.

Design and cut out your Smart Tattoos (at most four). Determine where you will place them on the cup so that they don't overlap and there is a path from the mouth of the cup to each one. It's best to space them out around the cup. ** Do not stick the Tattoos on the cup! ** Instead, simple pencil in where the Tattoos will go.

## Step 3:

Decorate the outside of the coffee cup (again, do not stick the Tattoos on the cup)

Don't put anything on the inside of the cup, leave it blank!

## Step 4: Cut out the design

Measure the size of the opening in the coffee cup and cut 5 pieces of paper that are the same size. Plan out your design on each piece of paper and cut them out.

Place pieces of paper on top of each other starting with piece number 1. Put pieces 2, 3, 4, and 5 on top of each previous one other in that order.

Tape the 5 pieces of paper together.

Tape the 5 pieces of paper into the cup to fill the opening.

Alright, we're done working on the cup design. You can put the cup aside for now.

## Step 5: Add the copper tape switches onto the board

Attach strips of copper tape (each about 5 inches long) to pins **A1** - **A6** to make 6 touch switches. Make sure the sticky side of the tape is facing up!
Fold the tape over itself through the pins to secure the connection.

## Step 6: Connect the battery pack

Connect the battery pack to the @boardname@ through the hole in the coffee cup lid.

## Step 7: Attach @boardname@ to the cup lid

Use a loop of duct tape on the bottom of the @boardname@ to attach it to the inside of the coffee cup lid. Since the board like the lid is round, it fits nicely inside. Leave the copper tape strips outside of the lid.

## Step 8: Put the lid on the coffee cup

Place the lid upside down on a surface. Carefully place the lid onto the coffee cup keeping the copper tape strips outside of the cup. 

### ~hint

**Important**

Take care to avoid tearing the copper tape as you place the lid on the coffee cup!
