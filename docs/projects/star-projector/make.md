Make a Star Projector for your @boardname@

## ~

## Duration: ~1 hour

### ~hint

**Important**

Make sure the [Code](/projects/star-projector/code) portion of this project is completed before making the star projector!

## Materials

* Poster board 
* [Dodecahedron Template](/static/cp/projects/star-projector/star-projector-template.jpg)
* Scissors
* Hot glue or tape
* Needle

## Step 1: Print and cut out the template

Using the [Dodecahedron Template](/static/cp/projects/star-projector/star-projector-template.jpg), cut the shape out of posterboard. Make sure one pentagon is large enough for the @boardname@ to fit inside it.

## Step 2: Poke holes in the template

Using a needle, poke holes into the posterboard. These will project the stars. 

### ~hint

**Tip**

Experiment with poking holes in the shape of constellations on each face of the dodecahedron.

## Step 3: Fold the dodecahedron

Fold along the lines shown on the template to create the 12 pentagons in the posterboard.

## Step 4: Glue the dodecahedron together

Use hot glue to seal each seam of the dodecahedron. You can also use tape for this step. Make sure to leave one face unglued (the @boardname@ will go in this face during the final step).

Set the dodecahedron aside for now.

## Step 5: Connecting the @boardname@

Use alligator clips to male cables to extend the servo. 

![Servo and wires](/static/cp/projects/star-projector/wires.jpg)

Connect the servo to the @boardname@:

* Connect the brown wire from the servo to the ground (**GND**) pin.
* Connect the red wire from the servo to the power (**VOUT**) pin.
* Connect the orange wire from the servo to the **A1** pin.

## Step 6: Connecting the servo

Poke a hole in the bottom face of the dodecahedron that's just large enough for the serve shaft. Insert the servo and attach the servo arm. Tape the @boardname@ to the top of the servo.

## Complete

Good work! Congratulations, you've completed the star projector make challenge! Turn on the battery pack and watch a planetarium show!
