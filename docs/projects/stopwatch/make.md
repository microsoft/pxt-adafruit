Make a stopwatch out of your @boardname@

### ~

## Duration: ~15 minutes

## Materials
* Tape (masking, duct tape, and/or packing tape)
* Scissors
* 1 @boardname@, battery holder and 2-3 AAA batteries
* 1 small patch of velcro tape
* (Optional) a picture frame, to help you tape the wristband together

## Preparing the battery holder

Add batteries to the battery holder before you start. If you want, wrap your battery holder in construction paper or tape to make it prettier.
Make sure the on / off switch remains accessible!

## Making the wristband

Put tape across one side of the picture frame.

Flip the picture frame over, so that you see the sticky side of the tape you just placed.

Place a new piece of tape over the previous piece. Try to align the two pieces of tape as much as possible.

Cut the double piece of tape free from the picture frame.

Next, we'll put the velcro tape on both ends of the wristband. Start by putting a patch of velcro at one end of the wristband.

**Flip the wristband** and put the other velcro patch at the other end.
It is important to flip the wristband so that both patches of velcro meet when you fold the band on itself.

## Mounting the battery holder

Next, we'll need to attach the battery holder to the bottom of the wristband.
Place your wristband flat on the table, and put the battery holder on top of it, near one end.
Make sure the on / off switch is facing up, and that it extends from the tape so as to not get covered up.

Put tape over the battery holder to hold it in place. Try to align the tape with the wristband so no sticky bit extends from it,
otherwise it might hurt your skin when you wear it!

## Mounting your @boardname@

The last step is to attach the board to the top of the wristband.
Put on your wristband, while making sure the battery holder is on the bottom of your arm, as shown in the picture above.

Then, take a small piece of tape, and fold it onto itself as to expose its sticky side all around.

Place the piece of tape on the bottom face of your @boardname@, and stick the board to the top of the wristband, on the opposite side of the battery holder.

Your stopwatch is ready! You can reuse this wristwatch to code many different projects. For now, let's code the stopwatch.
