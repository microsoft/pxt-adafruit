## Steps

### Step 1

Using the ruler and pen, mark a rectangle of more or less 26cm x 5cm on the T-shirt. Don’t worry if you don’t get it quite right, we’ll tidy things up later on.

### Step 2

Stretch the cloth using your hands and apply the double-side tape on the rectangle marked on the jeans. You might need the help of a friend to achieve this step. Don’t worry if the tape is larger than the rectangle, we will trim it later. Make sure to apply pressure to the tape to secure it firmly.
