Make your Gauntlets and power them with the @boardname@.

## Cut out gauntlets 

* Cut the long side of each piece of cardstock paper to form a point in the middle. This will be the bottom of the gauntlet.

## Bend the cardstock paper

* Curl the short ends of the cardstock paper towards each other to form a circle. This will bend the gauntlets to take a circle shape which is easier to fit.

## Fit the Gauntlets

* You may need help with this part - wrap the gauntlets around your forearms to fit to your size. Use a pen or pencil to mark where you should place the Velcro tabs. You may also want to cut down the length of the gauntlets to size.

## Stick on Velcro Tabs

* Attach the Velcro tabs along the length of each gauntlet – space 3 tabs evenly on each gauntlet.

## Mount the Circuit Playground Express

* Loop the ends of a piece of tape around to create a piece of double-sided sticky tape, and stick onto the back of the @boardname@ board.

* Stick onto the top center of one of the gauntlets – make sure the battery port is at the top.

## Attach the Battery pack

* Insert batteries in the battery pack.

* If your battery pack comes with a clip, pull it off.

* Insert the battery cable into the battery port on the top of the @boardname@.

* Position the battery pack on the inside of the gauntlet, close to the edge and try to hide the cable as much as possible.
* Tape the battery pack down being careful not to cover the On/Off switch.
