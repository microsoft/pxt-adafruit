# Blocks reference

Blocks snap into each other to define the program that your @boardname@ will run.
Blocks can be an event (buttons, shake, ...) or need to be snapped into an event to run.
The [on-start](/blocks/on-start) event runs first.

Blocks have many purposes. Some control the flow of your program, others save and access your data. There are additional blocks which control the features of your @boardname@.
