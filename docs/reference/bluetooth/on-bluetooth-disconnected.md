# On Bluetooth Disconnected 

### ~hint

For another device like a smartphone to use any of the Bluetooth "services" which the @boardname@ has, it must first be [paired with the @boardname@](/reference/bluetooth/bluetooth-pairing). Once paired, the other device may connect to the @boardname@ and exchange data relating to many of the @boardname@'s features.

### ~

This block starts an [event handler](/reference/event-handler) which in this case will run when a device which is connected to your @boardname@ over Bluetooth disconnects.

You could use this event handler to display a letter "D" on the @boardname@ LED grid so you know that the Bluetooth connection has been closed.

```sig
bluetooth.onBluetoothDisconnected(() => {
});
```

### Example: Displaying "D" when a Bluetooth connection to the @boardname@ is closed

```blocks
bluetooth.onBluetoothDisconnected(() => {
    basic.showString("D");
});
```
