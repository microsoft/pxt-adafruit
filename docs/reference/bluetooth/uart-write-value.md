# UART Write Value

### ~hint
![](/static/bluetooth/Bluetooth_SIG.png)

For another device like a smartphone to use any of the Bluetooth "services" which the @boardname@ has, it must first be [paired with the @boardname@](/reference/bluetooth/bluetooth-pairing). Once paired, the other device may connect to the @boardname@ and exchange data relating to many of the @boardname@'s features.

### ~

The [Bluetooth UART service](/reference/bluetooth/start-uart-service) allows another device such as a smartphone to exchange any data it wants to with the @boardname@, in small chunks. 

With the Bluetooth UART service running, this block allows a @boardname@ to send data to a Bluetooth connected device.

```sig
bluetooth.uartWriteValue("x", 42);
```
