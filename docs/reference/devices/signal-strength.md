# Signal Strength

Returns the signal strength reported by the paired device from ``0`` (no signal) to ``4`` (full strength).

### ~hint

The functions in the ``devices`` namespace allow the BBC micro:bit to communicate with a separate (remote) device, 
such as a smartphone, over Bluetooth (Smart).
The set of supported events will depend on the remote device and the BBC micro:bit apps available for the remote device.

})
