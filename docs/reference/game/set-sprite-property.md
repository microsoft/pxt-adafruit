# Set Sprite Property

Make a [sprite](/reference/game/create-sprite) store the kind of [number](/types/number) you say.

```sig
let item: game.LedSprite = null;
item.set(LedSpriteProperty.X, 0);
```

### Parameters

* the **sprite** you want to make store the number you say
* the kind of [number](/types/number) you want to store in the sprite, like
    * ``x``, how far up or down the sprite is on the screen (`0`-`4`)
    * ``y``, how far left or right the sprite is on the screen (`0`-`4`)
    * ``direction``, which way the sprite is pointing (this works the same way as the [turn](/reference/game/turn) function)
    * ``brightness``, how bright the LED sprite is (this works the same way as the [brightness](/reference/led/brightness) function)
    * ``blink``, how fast the sprite is blinking (the bigger the number is, the faster the sprite is blinking)

### Example

This program makes a sprite on the left side of the screen,
waits two seconds (2000 milliseconds),
and then moves it to the right side of the screen.

```blocks
let ball = game.createSprite(0, 2);
basic.pause(2000);
ball.set(LedSpriteProperty.X, 4);
```
