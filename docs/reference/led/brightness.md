# Brightness

Find how bright the [LED screen](/device/screen) is _when it is turned on_.

```sig
led.brightness();
```

### Returns

* a [number](/types/number) that means how bright the screen is when it is turned on, from `0` (darkest) to `255` (brightest). For example, the number `127` means the screen is halfway bright when it is turned on.

### Example: highest brightness

This program makes the screen completely bright when it is turned on (if it is not that way already):

```blocks
if (led.brightness() < 255) {
    led.setBrightness(255)
}
```


### Example: change brightness

This program makes the screen brightness 100% (255).  Then it turns on
the center LED (`2, 2`), waits for one second and then sets the screen
brightness to 50% (128):

```blocks
led.setBrightness(255)
led.plot(2, 2)
basic.pause(1000)
led.setBrightness(led.brightness() / 2)
```
