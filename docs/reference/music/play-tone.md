# Play Tone

Play a musical tone through pin ``P0`` of the micro:bit for as long as you say.

## Simulator

This function only works on the micro:bit and in some browsers.

```sig
music.playTone(440, 120)
```

### Parameters

* `Hz` is the [Number](/reference/types/number) of Hertz (the frequency, how high or low the tone is).
* `ms` is the [Number](/reference/types/number) of milliseconds that the tone lasts.

## Example

This example stores the musical note C in the variable `freq`.
Next, it plays that note for 1000 milliseconds (one second).

```blocks
let freq = music.noteFrequency(Note.C)
music.playTone(freq, 1000)
```
