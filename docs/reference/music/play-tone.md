# Play Tone

Play a musical tone through pin ``P0`` of the @boardname@ for as long as you say.

## Simulator

This function only works on the @boardname@ and in some browsers.

```sig
music.playTone(440, 120)
```

### Parameters

* ``frequency`` is the [number](/types/number) of Hertz (how high or low the tone is).
* ``ms`` is the [number](/types/number) of milliseconds that the tone lasts

## Example

This example stores the musical note C in the variable `freq`.
Next, it plays that note for 1000 milliseconds (one second).

```blocks
let freq = music.noteFrequency(Note.C)
music.playTone(freq, 1000)
```


### Using other pins

Use [analogSetPitchPin](/reference/pins/analog-set-pitch-pin) to change that pin used to generate music.

```blocks
pins.analogSetPitchPin(AnalogPin.P1);
```
