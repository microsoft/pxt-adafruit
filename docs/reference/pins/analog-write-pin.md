# Analog Write Pin

Write an **analog** signal (`0` through `1023`) to the
[pin](/device/pins) you say.

```sig
pins.analogWritePin(AnalogPin.P0, 400)
```

### Parameters

* a [string](/reference/types/string) that is the pin name you say (`P0` through `P4`, or `P10`)
* a [number](/reference/types/number) from `0` through `1023`

### Example

This program writes `1023` to pin `P0`.

```blocks
pins.analogWritePin(AnalogPin.P0, 1023)
```

#### ~hint

When you tell it to write `256` (for example), this function does not
_really_ write `256`.  Instead, it writes a lot of different numbers,
and their average is `256`.
