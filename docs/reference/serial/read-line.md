# Serial Read Line

Read a line of text from the serial port.

```sig
serial.readLine();
```

#### ~hint

This function expects the line it reads to be terminated with the `\r`
character.  If your terminal software does not terminate lines with
`\r`, this function will probably never return a value.

### Returns

* a [string](/types/string) containing input from the serial port, such as a response typed by a user

### Example

The following example requests the user's name, then repeats it to greet the user.

```blocks
basic.forever(() => {
    serial.writeLine("What is your name?");
    let answer = serial.readLine();
    serial.writeString("Hello,");
    serial.writeLine(answer);
});
```
