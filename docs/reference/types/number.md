# Number

An integer number.

### @parent blocks/language

A *Number* is an integer such as `42` or `-42`. More precisely, a *Number* is a signed 32-bit integer (two's complement).

### Declare a number variable

You can assign a number to a variable:

```blocks
let num = 42;
```

### Arithmetic operators

The following arithmetic operators work on numbers and return a [Number](/reference/types/number):

*  addition: `1 + 3`
* subtraction: `1 - 3 `
* multiplication: `3 * 2`
* integer division: `7 / 3`
* modulo is available through the [math library](/blocks/math)

### Relational operators

The following relational operators work on numbers and return a [Boolean](/blocks/logic/boolean):

* equality: `(3 + 1) = 4`
* inequality: `3 != 4`
* less or equal than: `3 <= 4`
* less than: `3 < 4`
* greater or equal than : `4 >= 3`
* greater than: `4 > 3`

### Functions that return a number

Some functions return a number, which you can store in a variable. 
For example the following code gets the light level and stores the value in a variable named `level`:

```blocks
let level = input.lightLevel()
```

### Math functions

The [math library](/blocks/math) includes math related functions. 
For example, the `absolute` function returns the returns the absolute value of input parameter `x`:

```blocks
let abs = Math.abs(-42);
```
