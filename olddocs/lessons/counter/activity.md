Display a number with a variable.

Welcome! This tutorial will teach you how to make a counter that increments when button A is pressed. Let's get started!

### ~

Let's start by creating a **local variable** `count` to keep track of the current count.

```blocks
let count = 0
```

The code under ``on button pressed("A")`` will run each time the user presses A. Let's add a line of code that increments `count` by `1`.

```blocks
let count = 0
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, () => {
    count = count + 1
})
```

Since the count has changed, it's time to refresh the screen display. Let's add a line of code to display the count on screen.


```blocks
let count = 0
input.onButtonPressed(Button.A, () => {
    count = count + 1
    basic.showNumber(count)
})
```
