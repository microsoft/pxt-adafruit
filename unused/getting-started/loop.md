## Loop

### ~avatar

So far, you've learned how to light up the red LED and show pre-made drawings on the Neopixels.
Let's make it animated!

### ~

The [show animation](/reference/light/show-animation) only shows one frame of the animation. 
To make it work, your program needs to call it many times. 
Instead of adding tons of blocks to the code, we are going to use a [while loop](/blocks/while.
Anything you place inside the **while** block, will run over and over forever.

```block
while (true) {
    
}
```

1. Find the ``while`` loop and add it to the code
2. Drag the ``show animation`` until it **snaps** inside of the while loop
3. Check the simulator to see if the animation works
4. **Try it for real**, click on **Download** and follow the instructions...
