## Red LED

### ~avatar

Your first challenge is to light up the red [LED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode).

### ~

#### ~hint

You can use the [red LED](/reference/light/red-LED) block to turn the built in LED **on** or **off**. 

Setting the red LED to **true** switches it on. 

Setting the red LED to **false** switches it off.

#### ~

```block
light.redLED(true)
```
1. Find the [red LED](/reference/light/red-LED) block.
2. Drag the block anywhere in the workspace, and set it so that it is switched **on**. 
3. Check your result in the simulator.

### ~hint

Use the color to find the block!
