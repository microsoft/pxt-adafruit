## Animations

### ~avatar

Good job on the displaying the pre-made drawings. Let's make it even cooler by creating animations.

### ~

You can use the [show animation](/reference/light/show-animation) block to show a pre-made animation.

```block
light.showAnimation(Animation.RainbowCycle)
```

1. Find the **show animation** block.
2. Drag the block into the code area.
3. Check your result in the simulator. Is it animated???

**Oh noes!** Something wrong, the lights are not moving. That's because the ``show animation`` block only displays one frame of the animation.
Just like in cartoons, you need to call ``show animation`` many times to create the animation effect.
