## Show Drawing

### ~avatar

Well done with the red LED! Let's light up the other lights!

### ~

The white boxes placed on the inside of the @boardname@ are called **Neopixels**. 
Each pixel can be programmed to show a specific color and is (awesomly) super bright!
You can use the [show drawing](/reference/light/show-drawing) block below to show a pre-made drawing.

```block
light.showDrawing(Drawing.Rainbow)
```

Let's try show a Rainbow.

1. Find the [show drawing](/reference/light/show-drawing) block.
2. Drag the block anywhere in the workspace, and set it to show a **Rainbow**.
3. Check your result in the simulator.
4. **Try it for real**, click on **Download** and follow the instructions...

We've packed a few other cool drawings in the library. Don't forget to try them out.
